# Week2
Week 2 project on Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. Includes data preprocessing, hourly resampling, handling missing values, visualizations, and ML/DL models (Logistic Regression, KNN, LSTM) with evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and accuracy.
# Week 2 – AQI Prediction using ML & LSTM

## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains Week 2 tasks for Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. The goal is to analyze air pollution data, preprocess it, and apply machine learning & deep learning models to forecast AQI trends.

## 📊 Dataset
- Input features: PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, NH3, SO2, Temperature, Humidity, etc.
- Target variable: AQI
- Data was resampled to hourly intervals and cleaned by removing rows with excess missing values.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (resampling, cleaning, encoding)
2. Exploratory data analysis & visualization
3. Train-test split
4. Model training:
   - Logistic Regression
   - KNN
   - LSTM (time series forecasting)
5. Model evaluation using:
   - RMSE, MAE
   - Accuracy & R² score

## 📈 Results
- Compared performance of ML and LSTM models.
- Visualized predictions vs. actual AQI values.
- Identified best-performing model for AQI forecasting.
